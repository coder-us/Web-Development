    <h2>Comparison to Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
    <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, whom he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[20][21] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[22][23] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, whom he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[24] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[25] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[26] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[27] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[</p>
